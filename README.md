<h1>Welcome to the Stream Command Booper app.</h1>
<p>The goal is to allow mass ban commands on Twitch to help combat hate raids, follow bots, and more</p>

<h1>Main UI</h1>

<p>Enter the target channel on the configuration section on the left, to set the Channek the commands will be run in</p>
<p>Paste the Ban commands into the Commands list</p>
<p>A ban command will look like "/ban username reason"</p>
<p>Press Start</p>

<p>Once you have Authorised the app, the screen will auto-close.</p>
 

<h1>Installation</h1>
<p>The program will let you know if you need additional files to run.</p>
<p>The app uses dotNet8.</p>
<p>On the first time using the app it requires the following, which the program will check, and then ask to download.</p>
<p>ASPNETCORE-Runtime-8.0.5-win-x64.exe</p>
<p>WindowsDesktop-Runetime-8.0.5-win-x64.exe</p>


<p>The program will ask, if needed, and when you click get, it will open your default browser to an auto-download page. First will be the ASPNETCORE. Find the file in your downloads, and right click, ‘Install as Administrator’. </p>
<p>Then, re-open the Stream Command Booper program. If you need the second file, the same thing will happen. Find, and open the WindowsDesktop-Runtime file and again, right click ‘Install as Administrator’.</p>
